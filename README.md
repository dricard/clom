This repository contains the source code to make a static website to be generated by [HUGO](https://gohugo.io).

The goal is to make an _online manual_ for the game **Clanlord**.

[Clanlord](http://www.deltatao.com/clanlord/)&trade; is an MMORPG made by [Delta Tao](https://deltatao.com/).

## Why

The goal is to make the onboarding experience to playing **Clanlord** easier by providing all the information that a new player needs to start enjoying the game.

Clanlord is the oldest online roleplaying game. It goes back more than two decades. It has no monthly fees, and a new character only [cost](https://deltatao.com/portal/) $10.

## How to Contribute

This is meant to be a resource for new and not so new players. I'm interested in all modifications that can improve the usefulness or veracity of the information or any bugs.

I use the GitHub issue tracker to track bugs and features. Before submitting a bug report or feature requests, check to make sure it hasn't already been submitted.

## Blogs

There is a section for in-character (or not) blog posts. If you'd like to contribute blog posts, either "community" blog posts or your own character's blog posts I'd be happy to host them on the site. Creating a blog post is easy. I have instructions on how to write the blog post and submit it [here](https://hexaedre.com/blog/writing/).
